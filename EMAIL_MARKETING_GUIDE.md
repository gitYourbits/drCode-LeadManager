# Email Marketing System Guide

## Overview
The email marketing system allows you to send personalized emails to leads based on their priority scores:

1. **High Priority Leads (Score 4-5)**: Receive personalized marketing emails focused on specific properties
2. **Medium Priority Leads (Score 3)**: Receive promotional emails with general property information
3. **Low Priority Leads (Score 1-2)**: Receive basic check-in emails

## How to Use the Email Campaign Tool

### 1. Access the Email Marketing Tab
Click on the "Email Marketing" tab in the top navigation menu.

### 2. Configure Your Campaign
- Use the sliders to select how many leads from each priority level should receive emails
- The system shows how many leads are available in each category
- You can preview example emails for each category using the "Preview Email" buttons

### 3. Test Mode vs. Production Mode
- **Test Mode (checkbox checked)**: Simulates sending emails without actually sending them
- **Production Mode (checkbox unchecked)**: Actually sends real emails to leads

### 4. Campaign Results
After sending a campaign, you'll see:
- How many emails were successfully sent
- Any failures that occurred
- Details about each lead that was contacted

## Email Content Generation

### What Recipients Will See
Each email includes:
- Personalized greeting with the lead's name
- Content tailored to their interest level and property preferences
- Company signature and contact information
- Professional email formatting with headers and footers

### How Content is Generated
1. **Hugging Face AI Integration**: When possible, email content is generated using AI to create truly personalized messages based on the lead's data
2. **Fallback Templates**: If AI generation fails, the system uses pre-written templates with variable substitution

### What's In the Emails
- **High Priority**: Contains specific references to property types, location preferences, and personalized investment advice
- **Medium Priority**: Contains promotional material about properties and services
- **Low Priority**: Contains simple check-in messages to maintain contact
